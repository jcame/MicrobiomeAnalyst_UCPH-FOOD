# Introduction to MicrobiomeAnalyst (Online Dashboard)

## Introduction

This is a respository that contains a general information of microbiome analysis using MicrobiomeAnalyst. Be aware that it does not include handling of DNA/RNA sequences, but rather what to do with an abundance table based on amplicon sequencing from a Dashboard approach.

Here is the link to access MicrobiomeAnalyst https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst/home.xhtml 

Detailed information about the infrastructure and dashboard benchmark of MicrobiomeAnalyst can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0264-1.pdf

You should know that microbiome analyses relay heavily on multivariate data approaches, whether you had introduction to multivariate data analysis, similar courses or did not received formal courses in this area, I will highly recommend you to do some reading here: https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame and here: https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/90/3/543/536864 


MicrobiomeAnalyst has several dataset examples: https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst/upload/OtuUploadView.xhtml (see the lower section: Example datasets for testing).

Additionally you can also download one of our in-house datasets available in this repository, e.g. zOTU_table.txt, mapping_Nat.Com.txt (containing metadata) & sintax_taxaEt.txt. This dataset was recently published in Nat.Comm.: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15311-y.pdf in case you want to get more details of the story.

A small tutorial (step-by-step) for Marker Data Profiling (16S rRNA) - can be found in MDP.pdf.
