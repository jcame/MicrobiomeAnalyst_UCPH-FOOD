# Introduction to MicrobiomeAnalyst (Dashboard)

## Introduction

This is a respository that contains a general information of microbiome analysis using MicrobiomeAnalyst. Be aware that it does not include handling of DNA/RNA sequences, but rather what to do with an abundance table based on amplicon sequencing from a Dashboard approach.

Here is the link to access MicrobiomeAnalyst https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst/home.xhtml 

Detailed information about the infrastructure and dashboard benchmark of MicrobiomeAnalyst can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0264-1.pdf

Microbiome analyses relay heavily on multivariate data approaches, whether you had introduction to multivariate data analysis, similar courses or did not received formal courses in this area, I will highly recommend to do some reasing here: https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame
